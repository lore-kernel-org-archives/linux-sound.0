So what the above is saying is that we should have a followup patch to
add the pinctrl setup to the DT (probably one that goes along with the
pinctrl changes and adds complete pinctrl setup for the affected boards
rather than just doing the audio piecemeal) and do the mindless call in
the driver.  That doesn't seem impossible.

So long as we get those things in place prior to the merge window we
should be fine.  Even if we don't manage that it still seems like having
the patch is better than not having it, from the sounds of it the boards
are going to be totally broken if they boot with DT but without the
pinctrl setup and the ASoC bindings are pretty much an orthogonal issue
to that.  Having the bindings for the SSC (which depend on this AFAICT)
will allow other machines which are doing a better job with pinctrl to
work.

Does that seem reasonable?
