Sorry for misunderstand. I split your e-mail into two parts. May be you 
miss some parts of my e-mail. You can check the last mail from me. Or 
check the following fully quote.

Yes. This is a purely virtual device. I add this as to the following reason.

In our case, the ssc can connect to audio codec, DAC and other devices. 
In order to avoid duplicate the code, so keep ssc as a library, register 
it directly in Linux and use remap method to let it work onto other 
different subsystem.

So, for ssc connect to audio codec, use dai to remap the SSC onto the 
Linux audio subsystem. In this way, just let the dai know which ssc 
channel it based on. The remap is just a simple way. Please take 
following code as a reference.

---<8---
         if (pdev->dev.of_node) {
                 struct device_node *np = pdev->dev.of_node;
                 struct device_node *dai_master_np;

                 dai_master_np = of_parse_phandle(np, 
"atmel,dai-master", 0);
                 if (!dai_master_np) {
                         dev_err(&pdev->dev, "No SSC for atmel dai");
                         return -EINVAL;
                 }

                 id = of_alias_get_id(dai_master_np, "ssc");
         } else {
                 id = to_platform_device(pdev->dev.parent)->id;
         }

         ssc = ssc_request(id);
         if (IS_ERR(ssc)) {
                 dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Failed to request SSC %d\n", id);
                 return PTR_ERR(ssc);
         }
         ssc_info.ssc = ssc;
         pdev->dev.parent = &(ssc->pdev->dev);
--->8---

If ssc connect to other devices, also need to remap to other subsystem.

I am not fully understand this. So, which do you mean as the following 
two method or any other else?

Our old method:
   using audio machine driver (e.g: sam9g20_wm8731.c) call 
atmel_ssc_set_audio function to allocate the platform device for 
atmel-ssc-dai and atmel-pcm-audio and then add device.

Code as following:
---<8---
/* Allocate a dummy device for DMA if we don't have one already */
         if (!dma_pdev) {
                 dma_pdev = platform_device_alloc("atmel-pcm-audio", -1);
                 if (!dma_pdev)
                         return -ENOMEM;

                 ret = platform_device_add(dma_pdev);
                 if (ret < 0) {
                         platform_device_put(dma_pdev);
                         dma_pdev = NULL;
                         return ret;
                 }
         }

         ssc_pdev = platform_device_alloc("atmel-ssc-dai", ssc_id);
         if (!ssc_pdev)
                 return -ENOMEM;

         /* If we can grab the SSC briefly to parent the DAI device off 
it */
         ssc = ssc_request(ssc_id);
         if (IS_ERR(ssc))
                 pr_warn("Unable to parent ASoC SSC DAI on SSC: %ld\n",
                         PTR_ERR(ssc));
         else {
                 ssc_pdev->dev.parent = &(ssc->pdev->dev);
                 ssc_free(ssc);
         }

         ret = platform_device_add(ssc_pdev);
--->8---

Other SoC do like this:
   register i2s device, and then register dai, finally register 
platform. So, only one device.
