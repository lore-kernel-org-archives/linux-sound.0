This approach has some issues. For example in case of thinkpad_acpi and hid-lenovo module is loaded (e.g. at Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet) the symbol request to tpacpi_led_set is successful so the thinkpad_helper will decide in favor of thinkpad_acpi. So I need to add something which checks the return code of tpacpi_led_set. If -ENODEV is returned it can try hid-lenovo.

Currently (including the other patches) there is only the X1 Tablet Cover LEDs which is controllable from external code. But the hid-lenovo driver is able to handle different Lenovo USB Keyboards.

If thinkpad_acpi and hid-lenovo is mutual exclusive it is impossible to let the thinkpad_helper control the LEDs of these external USB keyboards if they are connected to a thinkpad. I don't know if anyone will do this, but I don't want to take the possibility to do such thinks :)

OK, now understood.  But still make sure that it works even with one
of kconfigs is disabled.
