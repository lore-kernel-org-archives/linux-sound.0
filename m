i did "bk undo -a1.2463" from a current -BK tree and it oopses:

http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-debug_oops-a1.2463.t=
xt

(i've booted with different boot options this time, because i noticed that
i always booted with "acpi=3Dforce". changing this did not help either.)

next i wanted to do "bk undo -r1.2463" now to see if it does *not* break
without this ChangeSet (because i already know it *breaks* with this
ChangeSet) but that would leave some parentless child deltas. i read in
the BK docs that "bk cset -x<version>" would help here. but "bk cset
- -x1.2463" aborts:

- ---------------------
evil@atlant:~/kernel/linux-2.6-BK$ bk changes | head -n3
ChangeSet@1.2463, 2004-11-04 17:07:16-08:00, torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org
  Merge bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
  into ppc970.osdl.org:/home/torvalds/v2.6/linux

evil@atlant:~/kernel/linux-2.6-BK$ bk cset -x1.2463
cset: Merge cset found in revision list: (1.2463).  Aborting. (cset1)
- ---------------------

i've put everthing on http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/
the .configs, the oopses are there. i've double checked a kernel built
from "bk -a a1.2000.7.2" yesterday but the result was the same (no oops)

thank you,
Christian.
