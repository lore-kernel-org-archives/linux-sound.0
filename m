Sorry, in both these cases, I just forgot to snip the earlier bits, new
patch looks much better. Note, that in the case of several OSS drivers,
they are already replaced by ALSA ones -- and the ALSA ones are much
better maintained. A lot of the wait-queue bits in OSS seem to be poorly
done, or more obfuscated than necessary.

Oh well.

Thanks,
Nish
