The merits you pointed are irrelevant from the double-free bug.

It's a different issue.  The only judgment now is which one is clearer
to understand.  The code efficiency isn't a question for this bug,
since the error condition is very rare, and it's no hot path, after
all.

Right, I don't want to move it.

Yes, usually such a line should be enough.

Yes, that looks more correct.
