Ideally we'd introduce a {devm_}clk_get_optional(), with the same semantics 
as gpiod_get_optional(), which handles the finer details of differentiating 
between clock specified, but not yet probed, clock specified, but 
incorrectly and no clock specified, so this doesn't have to be done over and 
over by each driver.
