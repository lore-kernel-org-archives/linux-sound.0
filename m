After this patch go into mainline tree, I think we can ask it to go in 
-stable tree.

When we reload the module, as the codec is not configured outside, so it 
use default value, the 'Output Mixer HiFi Playback Switch' is in off 
state.If you want to play something, you need make it in on state. 
Please take the following command as a reference:
--->8---
amixer cset numid,iface=MIXER,name='Output Mixer HiFi Playback Switch' on
---8<---
