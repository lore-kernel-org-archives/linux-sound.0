So, you should add "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" just after your signed-off (maybe with a note that it applies on 3.12+)
[ actually, that's more a question than an advice :) ]

It doesn't seems to be related to the playback switches.
I check the TK/TD/TF lines, and nothing happens on them after the module has been unloaded/reloaded.
I enabled I2C/dma logs (on a 3.13-rc1 + your 2 patches kernel + at91sam9g35ek) and it seems that the DMA doesn't fill the SSC :
