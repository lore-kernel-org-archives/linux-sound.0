No, it has nothing to do with the double-free bug itself.  Such an
optimization shouldn't be put in a fix patch.  We need to concentrate
on fixing the double-free bug at first.  Then do an optimization, but
only if really needed.  Otherwise it makes hard to understand what's
actually doing.

(And, in this particular case, that optimization doesn't look worth;
 the error condition is really rare, happening only with a malformed
 firmware, and the path isn't hot at all.)

OK, that's another spot.  Let's fix similarly.

Vladis, if you take someone's patch as the base, you have to carry the
original authorship somewhere...

This comment isn't true.  The caller may leave it as is, too, like my
first version.  It just depends on the code.


thanks,
