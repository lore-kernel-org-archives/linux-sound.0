ok, so if the child driver wants to resume to full power it has to be done 'manually', the PM core does not help.

I think we are talking about different actions...

a) pm_runtime resume BEFORE system suspend. That would be necessary to deal with e.g. clock stop modes that are valid in pm_runtime suspend but not system suspend. It's not clear to me for example if all SDCA chips will support direct transitions from PS3 to PS4, or be ok with power rails cut while in PS3.

b) pm_runtime resume DURING system resume. That may be useful to restore functionality, but it's too late to handle problems that occur during the system suspend phase.

Either way, that's a bit orthogonal to this patch, more a discussion on how to deal with class power management.

You lost me with this sentence:

"
For SoundWire itself the soundwire host resumes all children
before a suspend, which dodges the direct complete.
"

If the direct-complete optimization is not used, then do you actually see a different behavior with this NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE flag set?
