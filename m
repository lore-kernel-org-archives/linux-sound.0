At the beginning I think as the same as you, and also add the code to 
get the data as I do in <drivers/misc/atmel-ssc.c>. However, as I 
remember, I2C seems only use the compatible string after the comma, that 
means only for "wlf,wm8904", it uses "wm8904" to match. So, I remove all 
the code I added, and just keep these, and it can get the device type 
correctly.

So, when I submit the patch and keep the code as simple as possible.

Thanks.

Best Regards,
Bo Shen
