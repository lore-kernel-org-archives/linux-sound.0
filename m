We kick off a background task from our component_probe() to do the
firmware download. We need the ALSA prefix, and also the wm_adsp library
that actually handles the DSP is ASoC code so it needs a probed
component. Doing it in a background work means it doesn't block probe().
And the download to multiple amps can proceed in parallel - obviously
that's constrained by bus bandwidth but we are seeing that they
interleave.
