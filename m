Thanks!  I didn't expect such complete patches when I asked for PoC,
and you've done much better than I thought :)

Honestly speaking, both look well acceptable.  From the pure kernel
POV, the 2nd patch is simpler, but as you pointed out, we'll need
another stuff to combining two sound cards.  It'd be likely a special
UCM profile, but this can be a bit hackish.

So, from the usability POV, the first patch would be "easier", and if
I have to choose, my gut feeling is to pick the first one.  But again,
I have no strong opinion, and both look good in general.  I'd like to
hear from others, too.

About the code, there are a few things to be improved.  The spinlock
could be done better with guard().  A temporary buffer could be
handled with __free(), too.


thanks,

Takashi
