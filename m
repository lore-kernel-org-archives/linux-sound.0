In case of that the tpx1cover is disconnected it will be removed from hid_lenovo_leds list. That means not included at the hid_lenovo_leds list. In this case dev is still NULL and the function will return -ENODEV. The static array hid_lenovo_initial_leds is still set to store the current state of a LED type. This is used to set the LED appropriately if the tpx1cover is replugged.

Maybe I should add a mutex to protect the hid_lenovo_leds list operations in hid-lenovo.c to fix the case if a unplug occurred concurrently to setting an led?!

No, it is sufficient if thinkpad-helper can access it.
