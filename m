I'm confused about what the issue is here.

- file->f_mapping is swapped out at f_ops->open time -> shared mapping
- Mapping here gets you folios that have folio->mapping == iomem_inode's
  mapping
- /dev/port goes away and...?

Is it that /dev/port going away then potentially zaps stuff it shouldn't or
doesn't zap what it should?

Be good to clarify all this and add a specific example also.

This is really confusing, so I think serious levels of clarity are needed
here.

Also is this intended to replace kernfs

This kind of insane 'swapping' would never happen on such mappings anyway
right?

I'd be careful about saying 'swapped' here :) for obvious confusion in mm
reasons.

But I'd actually explain clearly that file->f_mapping can be changed at
f_ops->open time and thus

Same comment on swapped...

Couldn't you just catch this at the top with the gloriously named
is_file_hugepages()?

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(is_file_hugepages(file)))
		return;

I'm not sure who's supposed to call this though, if it's literally anybody
including core mm that might want to unmap a hugetlbfs file maybe you'd
just take the write lock in this cae?

But probably better to be conservative first I guess.

(nitty)

I kinda hate mapping_mapped(mapping) as a thing, should have commented
about that on that patch, but then again what could it be :) naming is hard.

Anyway be nicer as a guard clause I think e.g.:

	i_mmap_lock_read(mapping);
	if (likely(!mapping_mapped(mapping)))
		goto out;

	...

out:
	i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping);

> +		vma_interval_tree_foreach(vma, &mapping->i_mmap, 0, ULONG_MAX) {

As David mentions this is now renamed to mapping_rmap_tree_foreach().

See above about file check.
