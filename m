No 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 are currently not merged to any tree. I reworked 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 because of some comments from Benjamin Tissoires (mail from 14th September 2016).

The patches are submitted to all recipients at the To, CC-Line (e.g. linux-input mailing list).

Maybe I can merge 2/4 and 4/4 together. This is all for LED control. 1/4 is for key/input handling and 3/4 is a special FNLock handling where I should use a separate patch.

Currently I have no feedback regarding the reworked linux-input specific code. I hope I will get it soon :)

Best regards,

Dennis
