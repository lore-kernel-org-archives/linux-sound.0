For example, if I want to add pinctrl node
---<8---
  ssc0 {
	pinctrl_ssc0_tx: ssc0_tx-0 {
         	atmel,pins = <1 16 0x1 0x0   /* PB16 periph A */
                 	      1 17 0x1 0x0   /* PB17 periph A */
                       	      1 18 0x1 0x0>; /* PB18 periph A */
         };
--->8---
This should be add into dtsi file as following
---<8---
ahb {
	apb {
		pinctrl {
			ssc0 {
				pinctrl_ssc0_tx
			}
		}
	}
}
--->8---

In the ASoC branch tree, I don't see any pinctrl related information. 
So, I say I don't know where should I add the pinctrl nodes.

May be I misunderstanding, do you mean I should only add as followign 
based on ASoC tree? And the upper go into pinctrl tree?
---<8---
ssc0: ssc@fffbc000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-ssc";
         reg = <0xfffbc000 0x4000>;
         interrupts = <14 4 5>;
+        pinctrl-names = "default";
+        pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_ssc0_tx &pinctrl_ssc0_rx>;
         status = "disable";
};
