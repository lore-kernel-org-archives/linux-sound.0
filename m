so for me Bo re do his patch series by splitting in 2 patch seires

the one via ASoC for the driver with the pinctrl for now but MUST add it later

the arch/arm related via AT91 tree where the pinctrl is mandatory in the dtsi

I'm no going to spend hours to do the pinctrl to test Bo patch that he is
supposed to have deon to test this code

As basically today on DT none of the board will work if BO does no provide the
pinctrl so for me he MUST put in the dtsi

is it ok with you?
