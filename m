for the driver point of view I agreee with you for the dtsi I disagree I miss
100 lignes of pinctrl description

so today if no pinctrl the pin are input gpio and the drivers will not work

if this code was tested this work MUST have been done otherwise we will apply
non tested work

so dor the dtsi part I do NACK it and the pinctrl code is arropund for 2 or 3
months so no excuse even Joachim who add the rm9200 support to DT handled the
pinctrl so no exeption on at91 when switching to DT the pinctrl is mandatory

If you want to apply the part of the patch that touch only the drivers I'm
fine but for the dtsi no
