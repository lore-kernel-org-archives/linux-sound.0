It's safe to allow bigger periods from the driver which are multiple of the DB 
size.

But apps should be aware about the information which area (e.g. period) is 
current so they should avoid to work in this area, if system task scheduling 
is probably going to interrupt this realtime data feed.

Basically, originally we took the periods as the base transfer block in API 
design. The period size and the filled count of periods (playback) gave the 
latency (of course without additional FIFO in hw path - just for the CPU <-> 
HW path).

And it's the whole problem. You are trying to solve a problem caused with the 
situation that applications do not know about those constraints.

But current PW behaviour is based on "assumption" that the data are processed 
in small chunks from the PCM buffer. And this assumption is not true for SOF 
while it worked perfectly for legacy HDA and all simple PCI (even ISA :-)) 
sound hardware. Also the initial transfer at the stream start is different. 
And I think that USB / FireWire serial buses are in similar situation. I saw 
workaround (special settings) in PW for those cases, too.

The xrun happens just because application do not push data to the next period 
in time, right?

> And this would just bring in the issue of the static DB that we have, if it is big, then applications would break if they want smaller periods.

We need definitely a handshake (app<->kernel) for this, but the question is, 
if just going back to honor the period sizes properly from the user space 
applications is a right way to go or not. IMHO it may be just a clarification 
for the current mechanism.

In any case we need those extensions:

Kernel -> user space:

- give the initial transfer chunk size to user space
- give the next (step) transfer chunk size to user space

The minimal requirement for the playback data at start would be:

	'init_chunk + (2 * step_chunk)'

Note that init_chunk may be zero (legacy PCI HW).

In my proposal, step_chunk == period_size and init_chunk will be provided 
using additional value in hw_params (as count of initial periods).

User space -> kernel:

- notification that the code honors period sizes + initial periods and uses 
period size to ask kernel for requested latency (keeping the current behavior 
for older binaries; and to allow drivers to do optimal setup)
- request for low hw_ptr granularity (to use e.g. deep buffers) - basically 
okay, we don't care, the "BATCH" transfer mode with whole periods is okay

Example (with the "honor period size" handshake activated):

20ms latency goal, 4ms hw transfers, 12ms initial hw buffer

-> set period size to 10ms or less
      # 2 periods must be filled to avoid an initial xrun
-> set buffer size to 30ms or more
<- get 8 periods x 4ms
<- 3 initial periods (3*4ms = 12ms)

suggested initial fill = 12ms + 2 * 4ms ; 20ms total

The driver (constraints setup) should take account the initial periods in this 
case.

> BTW, should we still keep the dynamic DeepBuffer as a way from the kernel to do things automatically? It will allow unaware ALSA applications to gain this for free, but it needs information to be given to clever ones (like PW) on how to deal with the jumps.

It's difficult to suggest something for this problem when the specific 
application does not give any hint to the kernel space about future API calls 
and expected use (if they will do rewind for example in future). We need 
properly document everything related to the transfers and let applications to 
choose between "expect data change soon" and "buffering" behaviour IMHO.

And definitely, we should not do optimizations related to single app - choose 
specific period size just because pipewire does not work correctly (speaking 
about the clarified API) - in the drivers.
