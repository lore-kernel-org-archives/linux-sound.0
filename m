It's not abstracting things, that's the whole problem.  It's putting the
internals of how the Linux audio stack is organised into the device
tree.  The point is that the SSC should be a library to all users.

A *huge* range of SoCs have generic serial ports - off the top of my
head this includes at least OMAP, PXA and Freescale.  The same issue
also applies to DMA controllers which affects almost all SoCs.
