M Control Center shows a MUTE beside each level these controls offer,
and the card keeps it: a MUTE left on by another host silences that
input or output here, with nothing on Linux to show it or to clear it.

Offer each as a switch named after its level, so that alsa-lib's simple
mixer joins the two and a sound server mutes through the card: the
inputs' MUTEs at property 05 of their targets, the outputs' at property
04 of both targets of their pair, and in Mobile Mode those of the
Playback 1/2 knob and the Recording fader at property 04 of theirs. The
card takes 1 for muted, so each switch is the inverse, on when the
sound passes. Each was pressed in the application and captured, in
both modes. The application writes them all off at each connect, and
so does the first bind here. The card reports the outputs' in its
announce, as 0x64/04 and 0x62/04, and that report has the last word.

The card also releases a MUTE by itself. In Pro Audio and Live Streaming
Mode, HP's volume written from the host while HP was muted released the
MUTE in 29 writes of 54, by HP's sound through a cable to AUX, and the
card reported each release at 0x64/04; a MUTE written right after the
volume did not hold in 7 probes of 9. No other level written from the
host released its MUTE. A sound server writes such a volume as a matter
of course: PipeWire, switching back to a device it has saved as muted,
writes the MUTE and then the volume 4 ms later, and the card released
HP's MUTE after 11 such switches of 20, for about two seconds before
PipeWire wrote the MUTE again. So a level set while its switch is off is
only kept, and the switch writes it on its way on, just before the
MUTE 0, as M Control Center writes a level turned under a MUTE before
releasing it. A bind and a resume, which write a level and then its
MUTE, leave a muted level to its switch the same way.

In Live Streaming Mode a level turned one step on the panel released its
port's MUTE in 257 turns of 260. The card reported every release of HP,
AUX and OTG OUT and most of IN 1's and IN 2's, and the switches follow
those reports rather than guess: a release left unreported stays shown
as muted, as M Control Center shows it. A level kept under a MUTE the
card has released, or one the card has reported, is dropped rather than
written over the card's own.

The MUTE on each of Pro Audio Mode's loopback returns has no property of
its own: the application writes the return's gain to off and, when
released, back to its level, and a return carrying a tone stayed as it
was with 1 written to 04 or 05 of its targets. Off is already the
bottom step of that volume control, so the returns get no switch.
