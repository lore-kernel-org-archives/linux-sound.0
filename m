This is for non-dt support, using the id to tell which ssc will be used 
to remap into audio subsystem. Maybe this is a mixed up usage, however I 
can not find good solution, any suggestions?

This is a similar implement as 7840487cd6298f9f931103b558290d8d98d41c49

This change won't broke other subsystem using ssc, only broke the audio 
subsystem if there are two codecs co-exist in a system.
I will fix this in next version.

Yes, this patch is a little more than registration, however when change 
the registration method, the related code will be affected, so also 
clean up them in this patch, do I need to split this patch?

Thanks.
