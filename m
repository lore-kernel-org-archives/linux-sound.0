You're setting yourself up for awkward merges. The driver change is
strongly dependent on the device tree change by failing probe unless
the device tree update is there, while before this patch, it still
worked.

If you instead use the dts update if it's there, you can merge the two
through independent paths, and later make it mandatory to use the
pinctrl specification. That way you avoid these complicated merge
scenarios where you have to send your platform code through a
subsystem tree instead.

But to be honest, I don't think this is a fix, it's a feature that you
just didn't include in time for the merge window. I don't really see
them as appropriate 3.8 material at this point.

So, nack on this series. Please make the driver change non-dependent
on the new dtsi contents, and merge that through the ASoC tree. Then
the dtsi update can go through arm-soc, and later on you can make it
mandatory.
