Hrm, does this mean that the ktime() isn't accurate enough, or do we
sample too short time?  i.e. Is it improved if we enlarge the
measurement time?

I don't remember of any machines with clock > 48k, so I guess the code
never hits on any real machines, and I'm not sure whether it's really
correct at a quick glance.

In anyway, I applied your patch now.  Thanks.
