What I wanted to say is that pretty much every user of clk_get() that wants 
a optional clock gets the handling wrong. E.g. they check for PTR_ERR(clk) 
= -EPROBE_DEFER rather than checking for PTR_ERR(clk) != -ENOENT. Which 
causes errors when the clock is specified, but incorrectly specified (e.g. 
invalid phandle or specifier) to be silently ignored.

My hope is that having a explicit API for requesting a optional clock might 
make it easier for users to gets things right.

If you have coccinelle you can use the following script to find good and bad 
users:

@@
expression clk;
@@
clk (
devm_clk_get
|
clk_get
)
  (...);
<+...
(
*PTR_ERR(clk) = -EPROBE_DEFER
|
*PTR_ERR(clk) != -ENOENT
)
...+>
