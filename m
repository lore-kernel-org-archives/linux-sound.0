No, -bk14 is just the kernel I am running right now (I haven't tried
-bk15) and I haven't had the problem. I cannot reproduce the oops _at
all_ which is why I suspect it's his hardware. I included my lspci and
dmesg output because we have similar (but not exactly the same)
setups.

FWIW, I've asked Christian for an obdump of the kernel to see if I can
track down where it oopses at because I cannot find anything in the
code. I suspected pcibios_enable_irq  (which is a function pointer)
might be wrong but looking at his logs, I don't think we get that far.
