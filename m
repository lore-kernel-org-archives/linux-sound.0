Okay.

You can cc everybody on the cover-letter explaining the change
and the individual patches can be sent selectively.

This is a kind of change it would be good to go as a series so
it will be easier for reviewers.

I had to comment on all 3 patches you sent - instead I could have
sent one reply to the cover letter. It makes it so much easier for
people to follow the discussion and add to it.

Please mention that then in the change log.

I applied this patch and ran alsa test without any issues. You
could do the same with:

make kselftest TARGETS=alsa

(but not so sure about the BPF selftests, as they don't compile as-is

I see a bpf patch from you in the inbox - if you mention the issues bpf
people might be able to help you.

I am not replying to your other patches. Take these as comments on others
as well.
